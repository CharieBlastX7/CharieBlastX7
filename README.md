## Bonjour mes amis

My name is Aditya Unnikrishnan. I am a student studying at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology, which is basically Vashi's central jail. This college is so strict in academics that the university had to reduce their portion to ease upon students. My batch is lucky because we have more time to focus on upskilling than cramming data which might not be useful later.

Ok, more about me.
I am an aspiring Developer who is also interested in Cybersecurity as well as Blockchain. My main goal is to become a cybersecurity engineer who can prevent cyber attacks from any malicious code/person. Other than that, I am also interested in new technologies, specially Gadgets and software and I am lucky to be a daily user of most of the modern tech present.

My experience with programming began when I started learning C (I initially learned HTML in my middle schol, XML in High School which I forgot) and immediately followed by Python. Luckily I had learnt Python earlier otherwise lockdown wouldn't have been productive ( 2020, what a year!). Currently I am familiar with C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dart ,a little bit of shell and certain frameworks like Flutter, React(hooks only), Bootstrap ( Bootstrap studio is a great helper ). Kudos to the creators of all these languages. I am currently working on developing a Cryptocurrency application, with my blockchain constructs and my team's solid development skills, we are making it a reality. Though, most of the concepts is a first time for me, but experience makes a man perfect. We will be in a position to handle workload as well as completing our assignments and homework. This will surely make us stronger in the end.

I am not completely dedicated to Computer engineering, I am a musician who plays keyboard. A badminton intermediate and I love drawing. I used to paint when I was a kid but now the paint box must have become dry. Currently I sketch. I also love watching TV shows. There's this one skill that I have, I can still enjoy a movie/show even after getting spoiled about it. That's what we should approach life with as well.

Thanks for visiting my page. I hope I haven't wasted your time making you read this.

Bye
